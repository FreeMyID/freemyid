# qa-security handoff
Done (earlier): scaffold review (docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md), conftest, fixtures, test_models,
test_state, test_crypto, test_storage, test_redaction, test_netpolicy, test_consent.
Done (v1 wave 1, 2026-11-06):
- Fixed test_log_file_redacted: CLI tests call logging_setup.setup(), which leaked a StreamHandler
  bound to CliRunner's (closed) stderr into later tests and made setup() a no-op. conftest's
  autouse `vanish_env` now removes/closes any root handlers a test adds and restores the level.
- Dropped the SEC-04b xfail marker (Store now registers profile PII).
- tests/ ruff clean (dict literals, import order, UTC, InvalidTag instead of blind Exception).
- New tests: Tier, BrokerStatus.tier, new TodoKinds, Todo.copy_fields (models, encrypted store
  round-trip with no plaintext on disk, never logged). SEC-15 strict xfail (copy_fields in repr).
- tests/test_e2e_dryrun.py: scaffold, skips until vanish.engine.runner.run and a dev module
  exposing fixture_registry() + fixture_server() exist (looks in vanish.engine._dev, vanish._dev,
  vanish.engine.devrun). Asserts D1 tiers, data-minimized copy_fields, nothing sent.
Open CRs: interfaces.py UP037 (orchestrator), engine/mail.py S110 (automation-engineer),
models.py SEC-15 repr=False (orchestrator).
Next: adopt src/vanish/wizard/_test_drafts and tests/fixtures/test_wizard_server.py (misplaced
test file in fixtures/) once wizard-packager's wave settles; un-skip e2e when runner lands and
align _load_dev() names; tools/registry_health.py; review engine/wizard/scheduler for this wave.
